#### DIVI Modal/Pop Up
This option transforms any regular divi module in a modal box with a CTA to display or hide pop up. it's pretty cool and easy to use. Just insert any regular module, like a text module or a contact form one. Then, inside the module modal settings you will see a new tab named "DE" just after the advanced tab. There, you must select the modal option and it will transform your module in a modal box and puts a button in replace. In DIVI oldest versions you won't see a DE Tab. Instead, you must navigate to appearance->custom css and adjust it there.
